# üìç LocReminder

A simple, open-source location-based alarm app built with Flutter. Never miss your bus stop again.

---

### Overview

LocReminder is an Android app designed for one simple purpose: to wake you up when you're approaching your destination.

Have you ever wanted to sleep on a bus or train but were too afraid of missing your stop? With LocReminder, you can set an alarm for a specific location. The app will track your device's GPS in the background and trigger a loud alarm when you get near, so you can rest peacefully.

This project is open-source and perfect for beginners looking to understand how Flutter integrates with native device features like GPS and background services.
